# :penguin: Pipelining Penguins :penguin: - Team 1 - Portfolio Site

Welcome to the portfolio website for Team 1 of the Pipelining Penguins Pod (22.SUM.17)!<br />

## Inspiration :penguin:

Our website theme was inspired by our pod name, the Pipelining Penguins, and the clever penguins from the Madagascar film franchise! You can see fun animated penguins on the landing page of our site.

## Description :penguin:

The blog has cards in the homepage, as well as a menu to guide to different pages of the website. For each of the three team members, there is a portfolio with an About Me :wave:, Work Experience :chart_with_upwards_trend:, Projects :computer:, Hobbies :video_game:, and Interactive Map :world_map: section. There is also a Contact page in which you can contact any of the three team members.

## Building Process :hammer_and_wrench:

To build the website, we used:
- Python, Flask - Template Inheritance, Block Content, Routing and Variable Rules
- HTML, CSS - Structure and Styling Layouts

## Installation

You will need python3 and pip for this installation process.

### Install the virtual environment

```bash
$ python -m venv python3-virtualenv
$ source python3-virtualenv/bin/activate
```
Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install all dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Install Flask
Install Flask inside the activated environment using pip(Flask is installed automatically with all the dependencies.):
```
pip install Flask
```

### To Use

Create a .env file using the example.env template

Start flask development server
```bash
$ export FLASK_ENV=development
$ flask run
```
The terminal will provide an address for you to view the website in a browser.

## Roadmap :red_car:
